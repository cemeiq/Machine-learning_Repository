Welcome to the Numpy-Pandas Beginner to Advance repository! 🎉 This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook named `Numpy_Pandas.ipynb`, which will serve as your guide to mastering Numpy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation and analysis. 🚀

## Notebook Overview 📔

In this notebook, you will find:

- A detailed introduction to Machine Learning algorithms, exploring both supervised and unsupervised algorithms. 🧮🐼
- Step-by-step tutorials on how to install and set up the required environment to run the notebook effectively. ⚙️🛠️
- In-depth explanations of various scikit-learn and pytorch functions, including hands-on examples and use cases. 📚

## Setup and Requirements 🛠️

To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
https://github.com/cemeiq/Machine-learning_Repository.git
```

2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed on your system. You will need the following libraries:
- NumPy 🧮
- Pandas 🐼
- Scikit-learn
- -Pytorch
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
  
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas jupyter scikit-learn
```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the cloned repository's directory. Then run the following command to launch the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. **Open the Notebook**: In your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8888/tree` and locate the `Numpy_Pandas.ipynb` file. Click on it to open and explore the notebook.

## Viewing Code Blocks 🚧

If GitHub can't render the code blocks properly, you can open it in `Incognito Tab`. Alternatively, you can download the `Numpy_Pandas.ipynb` file and open it in your local Jupyter Notebook environment.
